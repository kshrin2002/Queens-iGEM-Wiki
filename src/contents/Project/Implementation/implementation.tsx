                  scientific community but also helps avoid duplication of
                  existing work, reinforcing the project's credibility.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Understanding legal requirements:</strong>{" "}
                  Understanding the requirements for patent applications,
                  including the necessary forms and fees, ensures that SynAxis
                  complies with legal standards and accelerates the application

                Additionally, having a well-defined regulatory strategy allows us to allocate resources efficiently,
                including budget and personnel, to manage regulatory submissions, compliance activities, and
                interactions with health authorities. This structured approach minimizes the risk of oversights and
                ensures that we are prepared for audits and inspections at various stages of the project.

              <p>
                Finally, a regulatory strategy roadmap enables us to incorporate real-world evidence and
                post-marketing surveillance plans from the outset. By considering how we will monitor the long-term
                safety and effectiveness of SynAxis after it reaches the market, we can create a comprehensive plan
                that not only supports regulatory approval but also enhances our therapeutic's credibility and
                acceptance in clinical practice.

              <p>
                After establishing our regulatory strategy roadmap, the next critical phase for the successful 
                implementation of the SynAxis project is the development of a comprehensive manufacturing plan. 
                This plan outlines the necessary steps and considerations for producing our therapeutic product at 
                scale while ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulations. The importance of a well-structured 
                manufacturing plan cannot be overstated, as it directly impacts the quality, safety, and availability 
                of our therapeutic for patients.
              </p>
        
              <p>
                The manufacturing plan begins with identifying the production process, which includes the selection 
                of appropriate technologies and equipment for synthesizing and purifying our therapeutic. We need to 
                determine whether we will utilize in-house facilities or collaborate with contract manufacturing organizations 
                (CMOs) that specialize in biopharmaceutical production. This decision is essential for balancing costs, 
                production capabilities, and scalability. By choosing a reliable manufacturing partner or investing in our 
                own facilities, we can ensure that the production process aligns with our quality expectations and timelines.
              </p>
        
              <p>
                Next, we will establish quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols to guarantee that every 
                batch of our therapeutic meets stringent quality standards. This includes defining specifications for raw 
                materials, intermediates, and the final product. Implementing a robust QA/QC system helps minimize 
                variability and defects, ensuring that our therapeutic is safe and effective for patient use. Additionally, 
                we will prepare for compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), which are critical for regulatory 
                approval and maintaining the integrity of our product.
              </p>
        
              <p>
                Another vital aspect of our manufacturing plan is the development of a risk management strategy. This 
                involves identifying potential risks associated with the manufacturing process, such as equipment failure, 
                contamination, or supply chain disruptions. By proactively addressing these risks through contingency planning 
                and regular assessments, we can enhance the resilience of our manufacturing operations and ensure a steady 
                supply of our therapeutic.
              </p>
        
              <p>
                Moreover, scaling up production requires careful consideration of logistics, including inventory management, 
                distribution channels, and supply chain coordination. We will establish partnerships with suppliers for raw 
                materials and ensure that our distribution network can efficiently deliver our therapeutic to healthcare 
                providers and patients. This logistical framework is essential for maintaining consistent supply and meeting 
                market demand once our product is approved.
